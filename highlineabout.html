<h3>History</h3>
<p>The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long section of a disused elevated freight rail line transformed into a public park on Manhattan's West Side. It runs from Gansevoort Street, three blocks below 14th Street, in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to the northern edge of the West Side Yard on 34th Street near the Javits Convention Center.</p> 

<p>Repurposing of the railway into an urban park began in 2006, with the first phase opening in 2009, and the second phase opening in 2011. The third and final phase officially opened to the public on September 21, 2014. The final portion -a short stub above Tenth Avenue and 30th Street was scheduled to open by 2017, once the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project is complete.</p> 

<p>The design team reimagined the existing infrastructure as a "living system" that draws from multiple disciplines (including landscape architecture, urban design, and ecology) and has become an icon in contemporary landscape architecture. Inspired by the 3-mile-long (4.8 km) Promenade planta (tree-lined walkway), a similar project in Paris completed in 1993, the High Line has been redesigned and planted as an aerial greenway and rails-to-trails park. Its success has pushed cities nationwide to reimagine obsolete infrastructure as public space.
