HIGH LINE

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long linear park created on an elevated section of a disused New York Central Railroad spur called the West Side Line in New York City.
The High Line is an elevated freight rail line transformed into a public park on Manhattan’s West Side.  It is owned by the City of New York, and maintained and operated by Friends of the High Line. Founded in 1999 by community residents, Friends of the High Line fought for the High Line’s preservation and transformation at a time when the historic structure was under the threat of demolition. 
It is now the non-profit conservancy working with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation to make sure the High Line is maintained as an extraordinary public space for all visitors to enjoy. In addition to overseeing maintenance, operations, and public programming for the park, Friends of the High Line raises the funding to maintain and operate the High Line and its programs from both private and public sources.
