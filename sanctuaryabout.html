<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Hallett Nature Sanctuary is a four-acre nature preserve in Central Park. Originally called "the Promontory" by the Park's designers, it is the smallest of Central Park's three(3) woodlands and is the only permanently fenced-off section of Central Park aside from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir.
The area had been set apart by NYC Parks Commissioner, Robert Moses, as a bird sanctuary in 1934.<p> In 1986 it was renamed in memory of George Hervey Hallett, Jr., a birdwatcher, naturalist, and civic leader.
It remained an underused and inaccessible landscape that was closed to the public until 2001, when the Central Park Conservancy took up its restoration and maintenance to repair decades of neglect.</p><p>  As a result of the Conservancy's removal of invasive plant species and introduction of native plants, the sanctuary is now more diverse and healthier than ever, supporting various wildlife populations, including birds, raccoons, rabbits, and woodchucks.</p>
